# Exercise 1 :
# Given this list: list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20], find value 20 in the list,
# and if it is present, replace it with 200. Only update the first occurrence of a value

# list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]
# list1[3] = 200
# print(list1)

# Exercise 2:
# Unpack the following tuple into 4 variables

# aTuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# a, b, c, d, = aTuple
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
# print(d)

# Exercise 3:
# Accept a number from the user and print its multiplication table

# fav_number = (int(input("please enter your favorite number")))
# for i in range(1, 21):
#    print(fav_number, 'x', i, '=', fav_number*i)

# Exercise 4:
# Print the numbers from 1 to 10 using while loop

# number = 1
# while number <= 10:
#     print(number)
#     number += 1
